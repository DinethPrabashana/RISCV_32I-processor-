# RISC-V 32I Base Processor Implementation
This implementation includes only 38 instructions including no operation(NOP) and except all system instructions

## Overview
This project implements a RISC-V 32I base processor using Verilog. It includes core components such as the ALU, register file, and instruction decoder for the RISC-V integer instruction set.

## Features
- **RISC-V 32I ISA Support**: Implements all standard integer instructions.
- **ALU Operations**: Addition, subtraction, logical operations, and shift operations.
- **Register File**: 32 general-purpose registers.
- **Instruction Decoding**: Handles RISC-V instruction formats and immediate values.
